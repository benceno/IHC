        <p class="narrow">
          Dyslexia is the most common language-based learning disability,
          affecting between 5 to 17 percent of children in the United
          States. Children with dyslexia usually have difficulties learning in
          the classroom, so many students with dyslexia attend special education
          or receive one-on-one tutoring in order to receive instruction that is
          specifically targeted towards them. With effective intervention during
          the early stages of literacy, the gap between dyslexic and
          non-dyslexic students can be minimized. However, this intervention is
          usually not effective, because teachers for students with dyslexia
          have trouble personalizing instruction for each individual student.

        <h3>Our solution</h3>

        <p class="narrow">
          LearnAble is a reading management system to support personalized
          reading instruction for students with dyslexia. It has a library of
          reading passages, categorized by their level of difficulty with
          regards to vocabulary and grammar. Teachers can easily assign passages
          at the appropriate difficulty level for their students on their
          interface. To determine an individual student's reading level, a
          student can record themselves reading their assigned passage out loud,
          and LearnAble notes which words the student struggled with and finds
          patterns between those words. The teacher can use this data to gain a
          deeper insight into their student's reading level, and structure their
          instruction accordingly.
